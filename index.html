    <h1>Mouse - wind force simulation</h1>
    <p>This project was developed as a part of learning process taken from Daniel Shiffman's book 
      <a href = "https://natureofcode.com/">The Nature of code.</a> This project intends to create a wind force that is variable in nature and interactive, 
      through mouse position i.e., trying to create an effect, as if mouse's position itself acts as a wind force and that balls move away from it.

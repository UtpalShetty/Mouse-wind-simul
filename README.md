# Mouse Wind Simulation

Description: This project aims to create a wind force simulation, where the mouse acts as a fan, dispersing the objects away from it.

Stage: Still in process...... 
Currently the intended effect is partially achieved. Although we are getting a pronounced effect from the bottom right hand side of the canvas, this isn't the case for the rest of the three corners.
To achieve a uniform effect across the canvas would be the goal.

Aknowledgement:  This project is inspired by an exercise  from Daniel Shiffman's book "The Nature of Code". PLease feel free to check it out.
